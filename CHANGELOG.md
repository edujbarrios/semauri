# Changelog

All notable changes to Semauri are documented here.

## 0.15.0 — 2026-10-08

### Added

- `//` single-line comments and nestable `/* ... */` multi-line comments.
- Readable numeric literals with `_` digit separators and scientific `e` / `E` notation.

### Fixed

- Unterminated block comments produce a lexical diagnostic (`S105`).
- Invalid numeric separators, malformed exponents, integers outside the signed 64-bit range, and non-finite numeric literals produce `S106` rather than crashing the compiler.
- Comment delimiters inside strings remain ordinary text.

### Validation

- Language contract regressions added for both features.
- GitHub Actions checks Rust tests and builds/smoke-tests six native distribution packages.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-10-07

### Changed

- The reference compiler and CLI are implemented entirely in Rust.
- Semantic-domain registration and backend registration are public Rust extension APIs.
- External declarative domains can define artifacts, elements, typed properties, nominal types and deterministic operations without parser-specific cases.
- Runtime plans, effects/capabilities, optimization, filesystem execution and ML planning remain available through the native compiler.
- Official packaging builds one native executable for Linux, macOS and Windows on x86_64 and arm64.
- The source tree, tests, documentation and distribution pipeline are Rust-only.

### Validation

- Language, HIR, optimizer, runtime, schema, filesystem, ML and extension contracts are covered by Rust tests.
- CI checks the Rust-only repository invariant.
- Release artifacts are built and smoke-tested natively on all six supported target/architecture combinations.
